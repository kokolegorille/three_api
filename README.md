# ThreeApi

## Description

A fun interaction between Phoenix API (+websocket) with WebGL rendering (Three.js).

There is no database, just connect 2 browsers.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

To build the assets:

    $ cd assets/
    $ yarn install

or

    $ npm install

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
